# NutriAID

Test

NutriAID is a Node.js application that helps users make informed dietary choices by analyzing food labels using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or later recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start both the backend server (on port 3001) and the frontend development server (on port 3000).

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to use the application.

## Usage

1. Upload a clear, legible image of a food label.
2. Follow the prompts to analyze the label and receive dietary feedback.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version.
2. Try cleaning the npm cache and reinstalling:
   ```
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   ```
